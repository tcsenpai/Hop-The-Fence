## What is HTF?

HTF (Hop the Fence) is a simple extension that makes it easy to use services like 1ft.io, 12ft.io and self hosted services like Ladder and 13ft.

## What HTF isn't

HTF is NOT a way to bypass restrictions or paywalls or anything illegal.
Users should always ensure that they are allowed to access the services and the pages.

## How to use HTF

By default, HTF uses 12ft.io . You can click on the extension button and configure your own instance or your favorite provider in the options section.

## Note

HTF uses localStorage and the active tab url. Nothing is sent over to any server.
